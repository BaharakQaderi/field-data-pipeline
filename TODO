Develop the flight segmentation according to the pilot's requirements.
The new data coming from the Calabira campign, not punto fisso, but the POD10 and TK10.
This is the Test departement has been asking:
Sum up table for each flight
General
	Duration
	Average wind speed(if present)
	Kite_size
 
Nardo tests
	Average Total force
	Max total force
	Average back force (mean(mean left,mean right))
	Max back force (max(max left,max right))
	Average total back force (mean(left + right))
	Max total back force (max(left + right))
	Average difference back force (mean(abs(left - right)))
	Max total back force (max(abs(left - right)))
Vaie (remember 5th line is to be divided by 2)
	Is the brake on?
	Average Total force
	Max total force
	Average back force (mean(mean left,mean right))
	Max back force (max(max left,max right))
	Average total back force (mean(left + right))
	Max total back force (max(left + right))
	Average difference back force (mean(abs(left - right)))
	Max total back force (max(abs(left - right)))
	Average torque (left and right) mean(abs(torque_left),abs(torque_right))
	Average torque diff mean(abs(torque_left - torque_right))
 
TK10
	Is the brake on?
	Average Total force from FS
	Max total force from FS
	Average Total force from GS
	Max total force from GS	
	Average torque (left and right) mean(abs(torque_left),abs(torque_right)) from FS
	Average torque diff mean(abs(torque_left - torque_right)) from FS
	Average torque generator
	Max torque generator
	For all powers:
		Average power consumed/generated
		Max power generated
		Max power consumed
	All powers are
		Mechanical at the drum (Force*reeling speed)
		Mechanical at the generator (Torque*rotational speed)
		Electrical at the generator (Ask Enri)
		All following steps to the battery: ask enri/joey
 
 
	
Important from IPOK:
- Velecity magnitude (measured)
- Elevation (processed)
- Azimuth (processed)
